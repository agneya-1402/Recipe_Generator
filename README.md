## How It Works

- The app uses **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** API to generate recipes based on user input.
- Upon selecting your dietary preferences, meal type, cuisine, and other inputs, the app creates a custom recipe.
- The recipe is displayed on the page with ingredients and cooking instructions.

## Usage

1. **Dietary Preference**: Choose between **Veg**, **Non-Veg**, or **Vegan**.
2. **Meal Type**: Select from **Breakfast**, **Lunch**, **Dinner**, or **Snacks**.
3. **Cuisine**: Choose your favorite cuisine from options like **Indian**, **Chinese**, **Italian**, etc.
4. **Calories**: Set the maximum number of calories for your recipe.
5. **Allergies**: Add any allergies (comma-separated) to exclude ingredients you're allergic to.
